A personalized curriculum to complement certificate programme in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, with a heavy emphasis on modern **Neural Language Models (LLMs)**, **Transformers**, and **Advanced NLP**.

This plan is structured to provide deep theoretical knowledge from canonical resources (Deep Learning Book, Jurafsky & Martin) alongside hands-on PyTorch/TensorFlow and Hugging Face projects.

## Phases

The curriculum is broken down into 7 chronological phases, ensuring a solid foundation before diving into cutting-edge research:

| Phase | Duration | Core Focus | Key Topics |
| :---: | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **I** | Weeks 1-4 | **Quantitative Bedrock** | Linear Algebra (SVD), Probability, Optimisation (Gradient Descent), Regression. |
| **II** | Weeks 5-8 | **Supervised & Unsupervised ML** | SVM, Ensemble Methods (XGBoost), Clustering (K-Means/DBSCAN), PCA/t-SNE. |
| **III** | Weeks 9-12 | **ANN & Core NLP** | ANN/Backprop (PyTorch/TF setup), Tokenization, N-gram Language Models, Smoothing. |
| **IV** | Weeks 13-16 | **Advanced NLP & Embeddings** | HMMs (Viterbi), Parsing (CKY), Naive Bayes, Word2Vec, GloVe Embeddings. |
| **V** | Weeks 17-20 | **Neural Architectures & Attention** | RNN/LSTM/GRU, Seq2Seq, Attention Mechanism, **Transformer** Architecture, Hugging Face Fine-tuning. |
| **VI** | Weeks 21-24 | **LLMs, Fine-tuning, and RAG** | BERT/GPT/T5 Architectures, PEFT (LoRA) strategies, RLHF (PPO), Advanced Prompting (CoT). |
| **VII** | Weeks 25-28 | **LLM Engineering & Ethics** | **RAG** Architecture, Vision-Language Models (VLM/CLIP), AI Ethics, Bias, and Security. |

The core of this curriculum is the interactive HTML plan.

1.  **View the Interactive Curriculum:** Open the `curriculum.html` file in your web browser.
2.  **Navigate:** Use the monthly tabs to access detailed weekly content.
3.  **Track Progress:** Check the box next to each week's topic to automatically update your progress bar, which saves to your local browser storage.
4.  **Execute:** Follow the linked resources (`Watch` 📺, `Read` 📚, `Practice` 💻) for each session.

The curriculum emphasizes learning through implementation.

* Gradient Descent and FCNN from scratch in Python.
* Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and K-Means models using Scikit-learn.
* An LSTM for sequence prediction in PyTorch/TensorFlow.
* A text classifier by **fine-tuning BERT** via Hugging Face.
* An LLM using **PEFT (LoRA)** on a custom dataset.
* A **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system using LangChain.
